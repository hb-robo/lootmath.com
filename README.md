This is a site of personal projects where I delve into video game loot generation systems and the stuff they can produce, as well as reconstruct video game battle systems to find optimal player parties and loadouts.
For each game analyzed I will provide the source data, access to my intermediate and final results, and various visualization efforts.

Current game projects, in rough order of priority:
* Combat, damage, spawns, rolls, and more in **Dragon Quest (1986)**
* All of the above, grinding, classes, and more in **Final Fantasy (1987)**
* Monster and type design in Pokemon Generation 1, starting with **Red & Blue Versions (1998)**
* The weapon and shield generation systems in **Borderlands (2009)**.
